## Time Series Forecasting -- for Sales, Transactions, Visits

This capstone project is about forecasting sales for companies to make informed business decisions. For instance, if managers could have the projection of sales for the next two-weeks in advance, they would be able to properly allocate labor hours and identify the working efficiency of employees.


### Data Set

The dataset is provided by [BlueDay,Inc.](https://www.blueday.com)
It contains information about net sales, number of visitors to the store, labor hours, the units that have been sold at an hourly rate, employee skills, and sales goals for two years and more than 300 stores.

### Models 
After exploring the dataset, I found that patterns of sales,transactions, and visits versus time are very different under various time periods. For example, peaks usually happen at weekends and holidays and minimums occur on weekdays. In order to catch these patterns, I first used a traditional time series model -- [ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average).It takes seasonality into account and the prediction result of a sample two-week period (on the left below) shows that although the seasonal pattern has been caught, the magnitude of the prediction still needs improvement. After further exploring the data, I found that on holidays, the magnitude of sales and visits usually have a sharp increase, which is not reflected in this model. So to count for the holiday effect, I applied package [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) and adding federal holidays and store special events calendar into the model. The prediction (on the right below) performs much better and RMSE has been decreased to $4,540 compared with a mean sales amount of $26,000.
